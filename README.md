# PONG 

> "PONG" is a game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to train JavaScript commands that change the position and structure of elements in HTML.
The game consists of a ball that moves inside the field and two bars that serve as a defense. If the ball touches one of the black bars, the direction on the X axis is reversed and a calculation is made to define the new direction on the Y axis. It's you against the machine.
